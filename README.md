## ✨ What is Career Pilot?

**Career Pilot** is a full-stack, AI-first **career operating system** that turns job hunting from a chaotic, multi-tab slog into a single workflow. It's not a single-purpose resume builder — it's a unified platform that combines **resumes, mock interviews, job search & tracking, portfolio publishing, GitHub intelligence, fellowships, paid challenges, community, outreach, and admin tooling** behind one authenticated dashboard.

Powered by **multi-provider AI** (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Groq, Google Gemini, OpenRouter and a Bring-Your-Own-Key path), Career Pilot writes your resume, critiques it like an ATS, runs you through mock interviews with an avatar, tracks every job application on a kanban board, deploys a designer-grade portfolio to Netlify / Cloudflare Pages / GitHub Pages, parses your GitHub for risk and impact, and emails recruiters on your behalf — all from the same Express + React app.

It's modular by design: the Express backend exposes 30+ route groups, the React frontend has 50+ pages across feature hubs, and contributors can pick up **good-first-issue** tickets in any one of them without having to grok the rest of the system.

---

## 🧭 Feature Pillars

Career Pilot is organized into six tightly-integrated pillars. Each pillar ships its own UI hub, REST routes, AI services, and MongoDB models — and they share authentication, presence, notifications, and rate limiting.

| | Pillar | What you get |
|---|---|---|
| 📝 | **Resume Studio** | AI-built resumes, 60+ templates, ATS scorer, drag-and-drop sections, text-to-resume, tailoring, translation, versions & sharing |
| 🎤 | **Interview Sim** | Audio + video mock interviews with an avatar interviewer, coding round (Monaco editor, executed against hidden tests), 14 languages, confidence meter, replay |
| 💼 | **Jobs & Tracker** | JSearch-powered search, drag-and-drop kanban tracker, scheduled email alerts, company research, JD summarizer, recruiter outreach & tracking |
| 🎨 | **Portfolio Studio** | 250+ themes, AI content enhancer + extractor, deploy to Netlify / Cloudflare / GitHub Pages, custom domains, accessibility audit, SEO, GitHub sync |
| 🧠 | **AI Career Tools** | Cover-letter generator, email drafter (3 variants), LinkedIn optimizer, skill-gap analyzer, career-trajectory predictor, weekly digest |
| 🌐 | **Community, Fellowships & GitHub Intel** | Channels, posts, DMs, scheduled posts, paid fellowship challenges, Razorpay payouts, repo analyzer, project visualizer, CI/CD & dependency detection |

---

## 🚀 Quick Install

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and **npm 10+** (or yarn / pnpm)
- **MongoDB 6.0+** (local or Atlas)
- **Redis 7.0+** (local, Upstash, or Memorystore)
- **Firebase project** (Authentication + Firestore)
- Optional: **Cloudinary** for media, **OpenAI / Anthropic / Groq** keys for AI features, **RapidAPI** for JSearch, **Razorpay** for fellowship payments, **GitHub token** for higher rate-limits

### Clone & bootstrap
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anurag3407/career-pilot.git
cd career-pilot

# Install root, backend, and frontend deps
npm install
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ..
```

### Configure environment

```bash
# Backend
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — set MONGODB_URI, REDIS_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, RAPIDAPI_KEY,
# FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH, FRONTEND_URL

# Frontend
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
# Edit frontend/.env — set VITE_API_URL, VITE_FIREBASE_* keys
```

### Run locally

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (Express on :5000)
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend (Vite on :5173)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Visit **http://localhost:5173** and sign up. Two-factor authentication, social login, and Firebase auth are wired in — registration takes one click.

### Docker (one command)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The included `Docker-compose.yml` builds the frontend, the backend, and pulls in MongoDB + Redis with health-checks so you can be running in a single command on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

---

## 🏁 Getting Started

After installation, the most-used workflows are:

```bash
# Resume
cd frontend && npm run dev          # open /dashboard → "New Resume"
# AI: paste a job description into Enhance → ATS score + rewrite

# Mock interview
# Open /interview-prep → pick a role → speak or type answers

# Job tracker
# Open /jobs-hub → "Track" a job → drag across the kanban

# Portfolio
# Open /portfolio-hub → "New Portfolio" → pick a theme → Deploy
```

The **Hubs** (`/resume-hub`, `/jobs-hub`, `/portfolio-hub`, `/career-growth-hub`, `/community-hub`) act as mission control — every tool you need for that pillar is one click away.

---

## 📝 Pillar 1 — Resume Studio

A complete resume authoring + analysis environment.

|---|---|
| **Visual Builder** | Step-wizard with sections for Personal, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Certifications, Custom Sections. Drag-and-drop reorder with persistence. |
| **60+ Templates** | From `ClassicSerif` and `IvyLeague` to `TechMono`, `IDETheme`, `Glassmorphism`, `BrutalistBold`, `NeumorphismSoft`, `PhotoBanner`, `StockholmScandi`, `BerlinTwoCol` — pick the one that matches your industry. |
| **Text-to-Resume** | Paste a wall of text (LinkedIn export, old bio, anything) and the AI structures it into a resume. See `/text-to-resume`. |
| **AI Enhancement** | `Enhance.jsx` runs a multi-pass critique: ATS scoring, achievement rewrites with action verbs, quantified-impact suggestions, tone analyzer, consistency checker. |
| **Resume Tailor** | Paste a job description → AI rewrites your resume to match keywords and rank for that specific role. |
| **Resume Translator** | Translate to 14 languages while preserving layout and section ordering. |
| **ATS Scorer** | Section-aware keyword matching with role dictionaries (software engineer, frontend, backend, data scientist, PM, designer, marketing, sales, HR, PM, etc.). Returns 0–100 with actionable feedback. |
| **Versions & Compare** | Every save snapshots a `ResumeVersion`. Diff two versions side-by-side, restore any prior snapshot. |
| **Sharing & Comments** | Generate a public link (`/shared/:token`) with optional expiry. Reviewers can leave inline comments without an account. |

| **Speech-to-Text** | Server-side transcription pipeline (`transcribeAudio`) uploads buffer to storage and returns text — so any candidate can answer verbally. |
| **Coding Round** | Lazy-loaded **Monaco editor** with syntax highlighting. Code is executed against hidden test cases (`runCodeAgainstTests`) and graded. |
| **14 Languages** | English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Arabic, Russian, Turkish — the AI gives feedback and ideal answers in your chosen language. |
| **Company-Specific Bank** | A curated `QuestionBank` model ships pre-vetted questions for top companies. AI generation fills the gaps. |
| **Confidence Meter** | Real-time audio analysis + answer-quality scoring — see how you sound under pressure. |
| **Body Language Tips** | Browser-side heuristics for posture, eye contact, and pace — actionable prompts mid-interview. |

| **Mobile Kanban** | Swipe-friendly board for on-the-go status changes (`MobileKanban.jsx`). |
| **Job Alerts** | Define keyword + location + frequency; a **BullMQ** worker runs the query, dedupes, and emails matching roles. (`jobFetcher.js`, `jobAlertQueue.js`) |
| **Smart Email Alerts** | Open + click tracking via `emailTracker.js` + `bounceHandler.js`; unsubscribe links; weekly digest summary. |
| **Company Research** | Paste a company name → AI returns structured intelligence (size, funding, tech stack, culture, recent news) for interview prep. |

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm test                    # Jest
npm run test:watch

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm test                    # Vitest / React Testing Library
npm run test:coverage
```

Tests live in `backend/src/__tests__/`, `backend/src/services/__tests__/`, and `frontend/src/__tests__/`.

## 🚢 Deployment

Career Pilot is built to deploy on the platform of your choice:

- **Frontend** — `frontend/dist/` is static; works on Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, or any Nginx + CDN.
- **Backend** — Node.js process; works on Render, Railway, Fly.io, EC2, GCP Cloud Run, or your own VPS. `Dockerfile` is included.
- **Queues** — Redis 7 (Upstash, Memorystore, or self-hosted).
- **Storage** — Firebase Storage (default), Cloudinary optional.
- **MongoDB** — Atlas recommended; self-hosted works too.

See [docs/deployment-setup.md](docs/deployment-setup.md) and [docs/cdn-setup.md](docs/cdn-setup.md) for full step-by-step instructions.

## 🔄 Migrating from Other Tools

Coming from another platform? Career Pilot ships importers that turn your existing footprint into Career Pilot data:

| From | What gets imported |
|---|---|
| **LinkedIn** | `linkedinImporter.js` — profile, headline, experience, education, skills. Maps straight into a new resume. |
| **GitHub** | `githubImporter.js` — public repos, languages, contribution stats; populates Portfolio "Projects" and GitHub Dashboard. |
| **Existing resume PDF** | Drop into Cover Letter generator or Text-to-Resume — AI extracts and structures it. |
| **Other resume builders** | Import JSON or use the Resume Builder wizard to recreate; AI enhancer will close the quality gap. |

After import, run the **AI Enhancer** and **ATS Scorer** to make sure the resume meets Career Pilot's quality bar.

## 🧠 Project Notes

- The project is actively developed; expect weekly releases.
- Local-only by default; cloud deploy is opt-in.
- Firebase is the identity layer — configure a Firebase project before first run.
- All AI endpoints are rate-limited per user per route.
- Portfolio HTML is sanitized before serving; you cannot inject scripts.
